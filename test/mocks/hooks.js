/**
 * I teach smoke how to parse `application/vnd.ipld.car` files sent as the body of a request
 *
 * Usage:
 *  smoke --hooks test/mocks/hoooks.js <your mocks dir>
 *
 * Allows you to curl a CAR at your mock like:
 *  curl -X POST http://localhost:1337/car -H "Content-Type: application/vnd.ipld.car" --data-binary "@./pics.car"
 *  {"ok":true,"value":{"cid":"bafybeidd2gyhagleh47qeg77xqndy2qy3yzn4vkxmk775bg2t5lpuy7pcu","size":195}}
 *
